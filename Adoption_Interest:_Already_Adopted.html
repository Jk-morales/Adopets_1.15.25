<p>You can view our location and adoption hour details at <a href="https://www.nycacc.org/locations-and-hours/">https://www.nycacc.org/locations-and-hours/</a></p>
<p>Open browsing is available for all animals (e.g. cats, medium/large dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs) except small dogs. <b>Small dogs are not available for browsing and will require an approved application and interaction date scheduled with an adoption counselor.</b></p>
