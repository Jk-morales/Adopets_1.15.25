<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>Thank you for your interest in adopting from Animal Care Centers of NYC! We currently do not accept specific applications for rabbits unless they are in a foster home. Please stop by one of our locations during our open browsing hours to meet our adoptable rabbits.</p>
<p style="color:red"><!-- SENTENCE ON MEDICAL AND BEHAVIOR --></p>
<p>You can view our location and adoption hour details at <a href="https://www.nycacc.org/locations-and-hours/">https://www.nycacc.org/locations-and-hours/</a></p>
<p>Open browsing is available for all animals (e.g. cats, medium/large dogs, rabbits and guinea pigs) except small dogs. <b>Small dogs are not available for browsing and will require an approved application and interaction date scheduled with an adoption counselor.</b></p>
<p><u>Upon Arrival:</u></p>
<p>When you are at the center, please scan the QR codes near the door to add your name to the waitlist. Please note that wait times can be between 30 minutes-1 hour and the waitlist may close prior to 5-6pm depending on the number of clients signed up.</p>

<p>Rabbits require specialized care, please look over the <a href="https://www.nycacc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ACC_Rabbit_CarePacket.pdf">rabbit information packet</a> carefully, as rabbits have very specific needs that many adopters are not aware of.  Rabbit adoptions may require several visits to the shelter so that we can assess your readiness to care for a rabbit. <b>*Please take a picture of your current rabbit set up to show to the adoptions team at the time of your appointment.</b></p><p><b><u>Guinea Pig Adoption Fees</u></b>
