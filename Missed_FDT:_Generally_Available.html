<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, due to missing the final date and time provided to schedule an interaction with PET NAME, they are once again available for public adoption or alternative placement and may be transferred to another rescue group at any time. If you are still interested in adopting, we recommend giving us a call to check their status before you visit the care center. Please use the email below or call 212-289-8315 / 718-241-7166 should you have any further questions or concerns. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your inquiry. If this one is not the best fit, we look forward to helping you find a new family member soon! You can view our other adoptable pets here <a href="https://www.nycacc.org">https://www.nycacc.org</a>.</p>
<p>Best,
